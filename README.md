<h3>Contested Visions of Home: Asian/American Diasporic Subjectivities in the Media</h3><strong>Sat, November 19, 8:00 to 9:45am, COLORADO CONVENTION CTR, Level 3, Mineral Hall G</strong><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Session Submission Type: </strong>Paper Session: Traditional Format</p><h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote><p>Asian/American subjectivities are deeply shaped by the concept of home.  For some, home is a place of stability and safety.  Yet for diasporic subjects whose identities are marked by movement and displacement, home can be rife with contestation and disruption.  Asian/American understandings of home cannot be delinked from systemic racism, gender oppression, and modern colonialism.  Moreover, the troubled relationships that Asian/Americans have had to citizenship can make it difficult to speak up, voice their struggles, or navigate the violence and upheaval that have defined their experiences of home.<br />
 <br />
In this panel, we examine the creation of home through an interdisciplinary exploration of media representations, looking at the way Asian/American visions of home are created and overturned within film, radio, journalism, and digital media.  Through interrogating these representations of Asian/American bodies, voices, and experiences, we seek to answer the questions such as, what does home mean for Asian/Americans when the home may be the site of violence?  How do different forms of media provide access to Asian/American expressions of home, and how are opportunities for resistance both revealed and obscured through these stories?  As Asians cross geographies, notions of how they belong in a given moment are deeply shaped by violence and sociopolitical instabilities.  Violence takes on many faces: domestic violence, human trafficking, exclusionary policies, and histories of military engagement.  Within the stories of Asian/Americans in the diaspora, we seek to unravel the various contested meanings of home that prevail in spite of this violence, and in doing so, have come to define Asian/American politics, social dynamics, and history.<br />
 <br />Annie Fukushima will open our panel with an exploration of the violence against Asian migrants who have been trafficked into domestic servitude, asking how the concept of debt can help us to better understand their struggles.  Through an analysis of legal court records and media circulations, she posits a form of unsettled witnessing as key to understanding the way that these populations are rewriting their understanding of home.  Terry Park then explores the figure of Walt Kowalski in Clint Eastwood’s film Gran Torino (2009), asking how his history as a Korean War veteran impacts the relationship he builds with his Hmong American neighbors.  The way that Kowalski polices the borders of his white picket-fenced home can be read in conjunction with Trans-Pacific circulation of Korean War and Cold War security practices that shape our definition of “home” and “not home,” ultimately revealing what it would take to transform those boundaries.  Finally, Lori Lopez will present her research on the way that Hmong American women are using audio media in new ways that can begin to counter their long histories of displacement and disruption.  She argues that Hmong American women are using these different media platforms to broadcast their collective voices and facilitate conversations by using their own cultural heritage as a strength, and in doing so, can create a diasporic space of belonging.</p></blockquote><h4>Sub Unit</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+Load+Selected+Focus&selected_sub_unit_id=54110&program_focus=browse_by_sub_unit_submissions&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>American Studies Association Annual Meeting</strong></p></a></li></ul><h4>Chair</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7991226&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Patty</i> <i>Ahn</i>, University of California, San Diego (CA)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Individual Submissions</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1135220&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Questioning Home & Obligation: Witnessing the Trafficking of Asian Diasporas into Domestic Servitude</strong> - <i>Annie</i> <i>Isabel</i> <i>Fukushima</i>, University of Utah (UT)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1135221&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Go Ahead, Get Off My Lawn: The Korean War, The Gift of Freedom, and Guarding the Home/front in Clint Eastwood’s Gran Torino</strong> - <i>Terry</i> <i>K.</i> <i>Park</i>, Wellesley College (MA)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1135222&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Giving Voice to Hmong American Women: Aural Media as Home in the Diaspora</strong> - <i>Lori</i> <i>Lopez</i>, University of Wisconsin, Madison (WI)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Comment</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7991226&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Patty</i> <i>Ahn</i>, University of California, San Diego (CA)</p></a></li></ul>
 
 <h3>New Homeplaces for Black Popular Culture: Sun Ra, Nicki Minaj, Bombastic Laughter, and Black Twitter</h3><strong>Sat, November 19, 8:00 to 9:45am, COLORADO CONVENTION CTR, Level 3, Quartz</strong><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Session Submission Type: </strong>Paper Session: Traditional Format</p><h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote><p>Questions of authenticity and cultural appropriation have become popular and contentious topics in the academy and in popular media, especially with the rapid growth of new media technologies in the digital age. Debates about the performance of black style, dance, speech, and fashion call into question the value of blackness when produced for commercial consumption. We acknowledge the ways that Americanness is shaped by the constant exclusion of diverse people with the simultaneous consumption of their cultures for popular music, fashion, and humor; while many people do not and cannot feel at home in the U.S. because of racial, gendered, and sexual popular discourses, popular culture provides an avenue for subcultures to reach multiple audiences.  With the advent of digital consumption and global Hip Hop cultures, Black popular culture is used as a vehicle to access American culture and Americanness, regardless of whether black bodies are present. In many ways, Black vernacular forms of music, fashion, and even laughter structure how we create homeplaces digitally—including the ways that we interact with others based on their familiarity with Black popular culture. Therefore, we center Black cultural producers as progenitors and curators of Black cultural homeplaces. By conceptualizing Sun Ra and Nicki Minaj alongside Black vernacular humor sonically and memetic space digitally, this panel investigates the connections between past, present, and future Black popular culture in the United States in hopes of locating homeplaces for non-normative Black cultural forms.</p></blockquote><h4>Sub Unit</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+Load+Selected+Focus&selected_sub_unit_id=54110&program_focus=browse_by_sub_unit_submissions&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>American Studies Association Annual Meeting</strong></p></a></li></ul><h4>Chair</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7209547&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Lauren</i> <i>Muller</i>, City College of San Francisco (CA)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Individual Submissions</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1133777&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Home with Hitler?: Nicki Minaj, Butt Bravado, and Blaxploitation’s Legacy</strong> - <i>Aria</i> <i>S.</i> <i>Halliday</i>, Purdue University (IN)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1133778&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Making ‘Black Noise’: Bombastic Rap Personas and Black Vernacular Humor</strong> - <i>Lauren</i> <i>M.</i> <i>Jackson</i>, University of Chicago (IL)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1133779&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Stylin’ on Saturn: Sun Ra, Performance, and Home in the Era of Black Nationalism</strong> - <i>Brian</i> <i>Lefresne</i>, University of Guelph (Canada)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1133780&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>What is this “Black” in Black Twitter?: Race, Difference, and the Production of a Virtual Vernacular</strong> - <i>Brandeise</i> <i>Monk-Payton</i>, Dartmouth College (NH)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Comment</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7209547&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Lauren</i> <i>Muller</i>, City College of San Francisco (CA)</p></a></li></ul>
 
  <h3>The Seen Unseen: Queer Backdrops, Racial Labor, and Visual Culture</h3><strong>Sat, November 19, 10:00 to 11:45am, COLORADO CONVENTION CTR, Level 4, Capitol 2</strong><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Session Submission Type: </strong>Paper Session: Traditional Format</p><h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote><p>If home signals locatedness, it also implies a mise-en-scène.  How are props and backdrops designed to recede and make space for the raced subject?  This panel on visual culture foregrounds the background as that which produces the conditions of self-fashioning and of being seen.  Drawing on Arjun Appadurai’s work in “The Colonial Backdrop,” we explore how what appears ornamental can be structural as well as instrumental.<br />
 <br />
Across the disciplines of History, Literature, Philosophy, and Art, this panel contributes to contemporary debates about queer and racialized subjects as contributors of (often unacknowledged or unattributed) labor, whether physical, or affective labor.  Each of these essays considers the formal qualities, techniques of genre, and historical specificity of a particular medium (painting and animated film, literature, photography, social media) for how it constitutes the centrality of a normative figure by the contrast of a racialized backdrop or landscape.  By attending to a dialectical relationship between backdrop and foreground, the panel locates queer presence where viewers might be encouraged to see absence; it theorizes the way that racialized figures put on display as backdrop make possible the fantasy of an unraced central figure.  It also explores how new media provide opportunities for contesting the meanings of the bodies put on display, challenging the fixity of received cultural codes, and offering the possibility of reinventing new experiences of embodiment.<br />
 <br />
Chi-ming Yang’s essay on Disney’s Bambi foregrounds questions of style and the construction of the painted backgrounds of mid-20th century animation.  The uncredited labor of the scenes links the beloved American cartoon artifact to histories of Asian immigration and racialization as well as Eastern artistic traditions, even as the lushness of the pastiche offers possibilities and articulations of queer desire.  Visualizations of subject formation are further explored by Jerry Miller’s reflections on the imagined spaces within moral philosophy, namely the use of hypothetical examples of African American fictional characters—such as Huckleberry Finn’s Jim—that make legible and universal a white, readerly subject prepped to engage in ethical deliberation.  If the exemplary hypothetical competes with the primacy of the central figure, it also seemingly enables that figure’s centrality.  Tamara Walker’s essay examines this through the artistic representation of Black subjects in a longer history of visual culture across the Americas.  She places recent fashion magazine photography in a tradition of servant and slave portraiture of colonial Latin America.  Even as Black bodies signify the wealth of an elite family their presence also exceeds their function in the scene.  The connections between a history of beauty and a history of media are differently explored by Joon Oluchi Lee’s concluding meditation on idealized gender and digital culture in the case of Tumblr image feeds.  He addresses the virtual reality of utopic spaces of bodily self-fashioning in the blogosphere, where the feed becomes a psychological backdrop.  Rather than dismiss social media for its superficiality, he theorizes an “embrace of fakeness” that can lead to an alternate sense of the body.</p></blockquote><h4>Sub Unit</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+Load+Selected+Focus&selected_sub_unit_id=54110&program_focus=browse_by_sub_unit_submissions&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>American Studies Association Annual Meeting</strong></p></a></li></ul><h4>Chair</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7151868&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Erica</i> <i>Cho</i>, University of California, San Diego (CA)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Individual Submissions</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1134573&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Bambi as Queer/Chinese Dreamscape</strong> - <i>Chi-ming</i> <i>Yang</i>, University of Pennsylvania (PA)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1134574&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Race, Distance, and Moral Deliberation</strong> - <i>Jerry</i> <i>Miller</i>, Haverford College in Pennsylvania (PA)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1134575&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Black Servants, Whites’ Backdrops: Race, Beauty, and the Visual Vernacular of Luxury in the Andes</strong> - <i>Tamara</i> <i>Walker</i>, University of Pennsylvania (PA)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1134576&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>The Sweetness of Fake Meat</strong> - <i>Joon</i> <i>Oluchi</i> <i>Lee</i>, Rhode Island School of Design (RI)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Comment</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7151871&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Meg</i> <i>Wesling</i>, University of California, San Diego (CA)</p></a></li></ul>
<h3>Sound Studies Caucus: Race, Sound, and the Politics of Keywords Projects</h3><ul id="event_list" data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Event&selected_box_id=217584&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external"><p style="white-space:normal;"><strong>In Event: <i>Sound Studies Caucus: Race, Sound and the Politics of Keywords Projects</i></strong></p><div id="box_result_217584"></div></a></li></ul><strong>Sat, November 19, 10:00 to 11:45am, COLORADO CONVENTION CTR, Level 4, Capitol 5</strong><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Session Submission Type: </strong>Non-Paper Session: Dialogue Format</p><h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote><p>*Sound Studies Caucus Panel*<br />
<br />
In recent years the proliferation of Keywords related texts has become a resource and, in many ways, an essential “textbook” for organizing and addressing shifts in “traditional” fields. For the young field of Sound Studies, sound is used as evidence, method, and often a tool for theorization. “Sound” and “listening” are used by each panelist in their own writings to interrogate racialized notions of power and privilege. Within ASA, in particular, the Sound Studies caucus is committed to investigating issues, of race, gender, sexualities, desire, and/or citizenship through sound texts or approaches. We highlight this distinction given that recent Keywords publications dedicated to the study of sound have not. <br />
<br />
This panel invites a dialogue regarding 1) the institutional weight of Keywords texts to the development and professionalization of Sound Studies; 2) the marginalization and/or neglect of specific keywords central to the intellectual priorities of American Studies; and 3) renewed efforts to move away from words that describe sound to those that are structured by sound. Ultimately, this dialogue is about scholarly place-making tactics of “home” for larger discussions about power and privilege. <br />
<br />
Taking cues from work by Kandice Chuh, Lisa Duggan, and Bruce Burgett and Glenn Hendler, Gustavus Standler looks at the relationship between the keywords heuristic, field building, professionalization, and the consignment of certain subjects to the category of “identity” and “home.” Julie Beth Napolin focuses on the dominant strand of ethnomusicology and musicology in such keywords projects and their perplexing strain with the history of philosophy.  Several entries within sound related keywords projects began with a strongly Anglo-American intellectual genealogy, and then, as a second gesture, drew from fieldwork to test or demonstrate that genealogy. If Sound Studies were about analyzing audible forms of power, it would be important to critique these methods or at least depart from them.  	<br />
<br />
Jennifer Stoever draws attention to how whiteness constitutes itself through sonic markers and sounded exclusions. Whiteness represents itself as “invisible”—or in this case, inaudible (at least to white people). This inaudibility stems from the belief that white representations stand in for “people” in general, rather than “white people” in particular. While never seeming to speak its own name, white sonic identity imagines itself against circumscribed representations of how people of color sound.  <br />
<br />
D. Inés Casillas builds from Stoever’s ideas of whiteness serving as an auditory construction to focus on critical listening practices. For instance, volume levels, language differences, song choice, are all modes of sounding deviant, non-white or perhaps unassimilated.  A discussion about the institutional weight of these texts coupled their exclusion of authors of color and keywords relevant to studies of power and privilege, remind us of the significance of caucuses and the challenges ahead in carving a “home” for such scholars.</p></blockquote><h4>Sub Unit</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+Load+Selected+Focus&selected_sub_unit_id=54110&program_focus=browse_by_sub_unit_submissions&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>American Studies Association Annual Meeting</strong></p></a></li></ul><h4>Chair</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7155271&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Dolores Ines</i> <i>Casillas</i>, University of California, Santa Barbara (CA)</p></a></li></ul><h4>Panelists</h4><ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data=mini="true"><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7155275&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Jennifer</i> <i>Stoever</i>, State University of New York, Binghamton (NY)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7155278&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Gustavus</i> <i>Stadler</i>, Haverford College in Pennsylvania (PA)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7155280&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Julie</i> <i>Beth</i> <i>Napolin</i>, New School University (NY)</p></a></li><li><a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com//one/theasa/theasa16/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=7155271&PHPSESSID=ncsfa1rq2kvunbs8ra9ocqe8e5"  rel="external" style="white-space: normal;"><p style="white-space: normal;"><i>Dolores Ines</i> <i>Casillas</i>, University of California, Santa Barbara (CA)</p></a></li></ul>

<h3>Digital Humanities Caucus: Digital Shorts: Centering Digital Humanities Projects in American Studies</h3><strong>Sat, November 19, 10:00 to 11:45am, COLORADO CONVENTION CTR, Level 3, Mineral Hall A</strong><p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Session Submission Type: </strong>Non-Paper Session: Dialogue Format</p><h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote><p>The Digital Humanities Caucus proposes a reconceived roundtable session of five-minute “lightning talks” calling on conference attendees to present their newest digital projects, updates on digital works in progress, or related digital work including pedagogical projects. This proposal follows highly successful similar sessions at the Annual Meetings in Baltimore, San Juan, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and Toronto, and takes its format from the “dork shorts” given at THATCamps (a series of “un-conferences” begun at the Center for History and New Media, George Mason University and now held around the world). This innovative format creates an open space for all to contribute and fosters collaborations.<br />
 <br />
We will circulate a call for participants (via Twitter, H-AmStdy, the ASA website, and various email lists) in the month before the conference, organize the presentations into a logical progression, prepare a handout with the list of projects and presenter information to share with attendees, and allow for additional presentations from the floor. In recent years, presentations by some twenty participants have prompted conversations extending well beyond the formal session. Presenters range from senior faculty to new graduate students covering a range of topics and projects including digital archiving, data mapping, pedagogy, online publication, public history, digital social justice, and digital humanities tools. We expect the session will continue to grow in 2016.<br />
 <br />
The conveners of the session will again work hard to ensure that the presenters are representative both of the ASA’s membership and of the breadth of digital projects currently in progress. We will make a point to solicit projects that address the conference theme of home/not home. The conference theme suggests a focus on digital mapping and other digital projects engaging themes and places connected to home and its absence through migration, settler colonialism, homelessness, and indigenous presences in the Americas. We also plan to invite projects that interrogate the relationship between digital humanities and American studies, asking what happens when we center digital humanities work in American studies, and when we center the concerns of American studies scholars in the digital humanities field. <br />
<br />
Session conveners will also be in charge of moderating the session, enforcing a five minute maximum for all presentations, reserving time for discussion of issues the presentations raise, and facilitating that discussion at the end of the session. We will claim a hashtag to encourage online discussions during and after the panel session and conference.<br />
 <br />
